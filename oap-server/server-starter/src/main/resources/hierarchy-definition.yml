# Define the hierarchy of service layers, the layers under the specific layer are related lower of the layer.
# The relation could have a matching rule for auto matching, which are defined in the `auto-matching-rules` section.
# All the layers are defined in the file `org.apache.skywalking.oap.server.core.analysis.Layers.java`.
# Notice: some hierarchy relations and auto matching rules are only works on k8s env.
