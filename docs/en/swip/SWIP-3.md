# Support RocketMQ Monitoring
## Motivation
RocketMQ is a cloud native messaging and streaming platform, making it simple to build event-driven applications. Now that Skywalking can monitor OpenTelemetry metrics, I want to add RocketMQ monitoring via the OpenTelemetry Collector, which fetches metrics from the RocketMQ Exporter

## Architecture Graph
There is no significant architecture-level change.

## Proposed Changes
```rocketmq-exporter``` collects metrics from RocketMQ and transport the data to OpenTelemetry collector, using SkyWalking openTelemetry receiver to receive these metricsã€‚
Provide cluster, broker, and topic dimensions monitoring.
