# Compatibility

SkyWalking 8.0+ uses v3 protocols. Agents don't have to keep the identical versions as the OAP backend.

## Ecosystem Agents

All following agent implementations are a part of the SkyWalking ecosystem. All the source codes and their distributions
don't belong to the Apache Software Foundation.

| OAP Server Version | DotNet        | Go2sky        | cpp2sky   |
|--------------------|---------------|---------------|-----------|
| 8.0.1 - 8.3.0      | 1.0.0 - 1.3.0 | 0.4.0 - 0.6.0 | < = 0.2.0 |
| 8.4.0+             | \> = 1.0.0    | \> = 0.4.0    | All       |
| 9.0.0+             | \> = 1.0.0    | \> = 0.4.0    | All       |

All these projects are maintained by their own communities, and please reach them if you face any compatibility issues.

___
All above compatibility are only references, and if you face an `unimplemented` error, it means you need to upgrade the
OAP backend to support newer features in the agents.
