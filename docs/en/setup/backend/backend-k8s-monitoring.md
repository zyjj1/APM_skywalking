# Kubernetes (K8s) monitoring

Kubernetes is an open-source container-orchestration system for automating computer application deployment, scaling, and
management. It was originally designed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. It aims
to provide a "platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of
hosts". It works with a range of container tools, including Docker.

Nowadays, Kubernetes is the fundamental infrastructure for cloud native applications. SkyWalking provides the following
ways to monitor deployments on Kubernetes.

1. Use kube-state-metrics (KSM) and cAdvisor to collect metrics of Kubernetes resources, such as CPU, service, pod, and
   node. Read [kube-state-metrics and cAdvisor setup guide](./backend-k8s-monitoring-metrics-cadvisor.md) for more details.
2. Rover is a SkyWalking native eBPF agent to collect network Access Logs to support topology-aware and metrics 
   analysis. Meanwhile, due to the power of eBPF, it could profile running services written by C++, Rust, Golang, etc. 
   Read [Rover setup guide](./backend-k8s-monitoring-rover.md) for more details.

SkyWalking deeply integrates with Kubernetes to help users understand the status of their applications on Kubernetes.
